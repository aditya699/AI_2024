# APP-1 Stock price prediction using RNN/LSTM
This project aims to predict stock prices using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). By leveraging historical stock price data sourced from Yahoo Finance, we have developed a proof-of-concept (POC) that predicts closing prices based on opening prices.


# Key Features:
Utilizes historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance.
Trains an RNN model to predict closing prices based on opening prices.Includes data preprocessing and evaluation metrics.

# Technologies Used:
Python

PyTorch

pandas

scikit-learn
